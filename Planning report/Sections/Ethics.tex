\section{Ethics}

The developed tool will probably not affect society in a particular negative way. The only topic worth mentioning is that some people might lose their jobs if companies start using this tool. For instance, people working with designing game cities may be affected, since the tool will automate their jobs. On the other hand, our tool will make game development easier for smaller development teams as well as for hobbyists. Besides, automated generation has been widespread in graphics for decades, and this tool is merely meant to serve as a basis upon which games can be developed.

Since the generated content does not focus on realistically representing the real world, it will disregard some real ethical aspects. It will, for instance, not focus on the ethics of available transportation systems, such as trains and busses, that otherwise are considered in real cities. The tool will instead generate cities that only contain roads used by cars in and around it. This may be seen as only representing a sub-part of the real world, however as described in section \ref{section:delimitations}, the tool focuses on credibility rather than realism.
