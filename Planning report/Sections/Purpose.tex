\section{Purpose}
The focus of this thesis is to investigate how game development can be made less time-consuming and more cost-effective, by developing a tool for creating 3D cities and surrounding terrain using procedural content generation. Cities developed with the tool are supposed to be usable in a variety of city-based games to make development processes more effortless.
