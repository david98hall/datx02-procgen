# BIAS - A Procedural Content Generation Tool for Generating Cities in Unity

BIAS stands for "Built In A Second" (derived from the saying "Rome was not built in a day") and is a Unity extension that makes it easier for both professional game developers and hobbyists to create 3D city assets for their games. It uses procedural content generation with some user input to generate cities that consist of terrain, road networks and buildings. The tool was developed as a Bachelor's project at Chalmers University of Technology.

The Bachelor's thesis of the project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w27e40J0BUkVa_c9lEFAAb4XK3_CBJHg/view).
